# The Wallet List Application

The Wallet List app is a store-front application that allows a list owner to add credits to a gift card that has been previously generated by their gift list.

## Installing

### The Store

To install the application on the store and thus be able to manage your wallet, you need to run the following command in your terminal

```json
  vtex install vtex.list-wallet@0.x
```
Once the app is installed, you can add the app to your store theme using the line

```json
  store-wallet-list 
```

## The Operation

### On Store

In the store, the list owner can check the available credit which can be added to the gift card, and the current balance of their gift card. The available credit is calculated from the difference between the cash balance of the lists and the amount that has already been added to the gift card.

In addition, it will be possible to make redemptions in the "Generate Redemption" field, as long as the input value is within the range of credit at hand for the redemption. Finally, the gift card code will also be available and can be copied by clicking on the "Copy Code" button.
