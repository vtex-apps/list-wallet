# The Wallet of the Gift List Application

This application is a dependency of the [`vtex.list`](https://github.com/vtex/list) application. This app is a store-front application that allows a list owner to add credits to a gift card that has been previously generated by their gift list.

In the store, the list owner can check the available credit which can be added to the gift card, and the current balance of their gift card. In addition, it will be possible to make redemptions in the "Generate Redemption" field. The gift card code will also be available and can be copied by clicking on the "Copy Code" button. To finish, it's possible to see the
the account statement of gift card.

This app depends on `vtex.gift-card-list` configuration to work properly.
